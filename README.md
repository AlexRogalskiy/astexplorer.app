> AST Explorer (https://astexplorer.net) with Desktop Integration

## Contributing

The Web UI used on https://astexplorer.net is built from source from its repository at
https://github.com/fkling/astexplorer and checked into this repository at `/website` using the
command `yarn run pull-upstream`.

The `/website` directory is then wrapped in an Electron app to provide Desktop Integration.
